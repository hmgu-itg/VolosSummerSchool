        "- Compute the two scores by hand in R and using Plink\n",
        "- See how well these two scores predict the traits in question\n",
        "- Study the influence of ethnicity, and adjust for it\n",
        "- Examine the polygenicity of these two traits through a genome-wide association.\n",

Variants in that score are identified by chromosome:position, but are on build 37 (also called hg19) of the human reference genome. Our genetic data is on build 38, and we must therefore first map these coordinates onto that build to apply the PGS to the genetic data. That process is called a liftover. We have provided you the score in the right build for the previous exercise but in this optional exercise, we give you the possibility to perform the liftover yourself.\n",
