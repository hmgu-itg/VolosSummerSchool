    "# Basic UNIX\n",

    "## What is UNIX?\n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX is an **operating system** (analogous to DOS and Windows) which was first developed in the 1960s. By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The UNIX operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX itself is historical, but it has spawned many different modern operating systems, such as Linux (Fedora, Suse, Arch, Red Star Linux…and Ubuntu) and BSD\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to Windows and MAC OS X, UNIX-based systems do not rely on a graphical interface\n",
    "- With UNIX, you don’t use the mouse!\n",
    "- With Linux, you often do (GUI is integrated)\n",
    "  - But advanced use often requires a text-only interface\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts: the kernel, the shell and the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"kernel.png\" width=\"40%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration of the way that the shell and the kernel work together, suppose a user types *rm myfile* (which has the effect of removing the file myfile). The shell searches the filestore for the file containing the program rm, and then requests the kernel, through system calls, to execute the program rm on myfile. When the process rm myfile has finished running, the shell then returns the UNIX prompt % to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"shell.png\" width=\"40%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text-only, you say?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is now forgotten, but all historical computers ran on text-only interfaces (MS-DOS before Windows, OS/2 before Mac OS)\n",
    "- They are really useful for file and data manipulation\n",
    "- On Windows, we use emulators (which imitate UNIX behaviour) and remote access programs (which connect to real UNIX systems)\n",
    "- Every action has to be typed on the screen and sent to the system by hitting ENTER.\n",
    "- You are always in a directory, every command you send will affect the current directory unless stated otherwise\n",
    "- When you send a command, the system will look it up\n",
    "  - If it is a system command, it will execute it itself\n",
    "  - If not, it will look if it’s a third-party program installed on the computer\n",
    "  - If not, it will yell at you.\n",

    "\t - apropos copy\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have to remember all the arguments for every command\n",
    "  - If you remember the name you can get help about the arguments\n",
    "  - Most commands have a “help me” argument\n",
